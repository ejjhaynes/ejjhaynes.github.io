**What did you do this past week?**

Last week, my main focus was on trying to get the first phase of the project done. I also went to HackTX over the weekend and slept the rest of Sunday away

**Whatâ€™s in your way?**

I just have a lot to do. As per always. 

**What will you do next week?**

I have to catch up on a lot of readings for my Info Studies class, finish a homework and my part of the alpha version of the final project for iOS, and obviously work on part two of this project. We ran out of time to make all the changes to the front end that we wanted, so I'll try to do some of those before we meet for phase II steps. I will hopefully hear back from a couple of companies this week, to see where my standings are thus far. 

**Class Impressions**

The project requirements were clear or internally consistent. My group had a lot of trouble figuring out what exactly was due for phase I in terms of back end requirements. Looking around at other groups' websites, we really weren't the only ones who felt pressed for time. 

**Tip of the Week**

Going into HackTX with low expectations actually made it really fun and no stress. Tip: bring a blanket. It was so very cold. 
But yeah! Hackathons can be really fun, and feel free to ask for help. Participate in different activities just because why not, and if you happen to have a really cool idea, you can win /really cool/ stuff.
