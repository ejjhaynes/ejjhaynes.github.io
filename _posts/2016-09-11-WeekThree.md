**What did you do this past week?**

I finished Collatz (not on time, but still. Finished.), to end three days of 4 assignments and 5 readings. Last week was strangely busy all at once, but I made it through. I also finished a gift for a friend who's in town this weekend, which was more time-consuming than I expected it to be, so juggling all my busyness was an adventure, and it didn't always go well.

**Whatâ€™s in your way?**

4/5 of my classes this semester are ones I'm properly interested in taking, so I need to keep focused on working on all of them, rather than doing the minimum required to get a halfway decent grade as I focus on the classes I care about. However, this means that I'm going to be putting forth effort into a higher percentage of my time than I have in the past, so I need to make sure I don't burn out.

**What will you do next week?**

I'm going to make a proper schedule this week for homework and work so that I don't end up in the same time crunch I did this week, and start early on _everything_.

**Class Impressions**

The fact that you get no credit without passing Sphere code was very frustrating. Even with all the optimizations the instructors said were necessary, my Collatz code was not fast enough, so I had to implement the metacache, which I did not plan on doing, because I was under the impression it was not required. I somewhat understand the requirement, but if your code passes reasonable acceptance tests and those of other students', and has all the requirements discussed in class and on Piazza, I feel that credit is deserved. 

**Tip of the Week**

In my Intro to Information Studies class, we discussed a primitive AI from the 1960's called [ELIZA](http://www.manifestation.com/neurotoys/eliza.php3). "She" was made to emulate Rogerian therapists, and thus was basically a blank mirror that asks the user about themself and operates with nearly no actual facts in her repository. Despite this, some users at that time almost thought she was an actual person, and held lengthy conversations with her. Comparing Eliza to current AIs such as Siri and Cleverbot shows both how far we've come and how far we have yet to go.
