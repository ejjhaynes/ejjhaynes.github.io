**What did you do this past week?**

I wrote an essay, took an exam, didn't sleep much, and went out of town. I did catch up on my readings during my travels, though, so that's something. Travelling kept me from doing much group work, but last week also consisted of getting the group solidified and coming up with an idea.

**Whatâ€™s in your way?**

I continue to have zero experience with web development, but looks like this week I'll start learning! This weekend is HackTX so I'm going to have to make sure I'm not terribly behind next week by attempting to get ahead now, as so far it doesn't seem like I have terribly pressing due dates. 

**What will you do next week?**

This coming week will involve trying to get ahead as stated above, and trying to juggle three group projects at the same time should be an adventure, but unfortunately not the fun kind.

**Class Impressions**

Seven people in one group is /big/ when everyone is in school. I understand that a development team in the ~real world~ could be that size, but at least then everyone is usually at work at approximately the same time and in approximately the same place. I suspect that scheduling is going to be a bit of a nightmare.

**Tip of the Week**

Hinting to your roommate that they should go grocery shopping while you're gone for the weekend because it hasn't been done in two weeks doesn't work. Communicate clearly and effectively for a better life.
