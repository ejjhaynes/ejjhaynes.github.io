**What did you do this past week?**

My team finished Phase III of the IDB project, and I think we did a pretty good job. Everything links to itself, and the only things I would really want to change are more aesthetics than functionality. 

**Whatâ€™s in your way?**

Casual sexism, apparently.

**What will you do next week?**

This week is Thanksgiving! So probably not much. I have three presentations next week that I need to prepare for, but I'm setting aside most of the time I'm at home to be with family and friends. 

**Class Impressions**

There was an entirely unacceptable incident in class today. A presenter mentioned that their site was not very pretty, and that 'maybe it would look nicer if we had a female on our team'. This comment alone was demeaning and upsetting, implying that women are only good for front end and design work, a stereotype already perpetuated in media that translates to women being taken less seriously in the workforce in all areas of tech, as design is seen as "easy" work (even though this idea somehow exists simultaneously with the idea that men cannot do it as well, so is it hard?). From an all male group, unfortunately, this comment is not terribly surprising. What was surprising was Professor Downing's not only lack of condemnation, but his participation in this idea. Later in the presentation, this group was critiquing another group's website and said that the whole site essentially looked better than theirs, and Downing laughingly said "they had a girl in their group." I expect so much higher standards from our CS professors than Downing exhibited today. Microaggressions like this are a lot of the reason that women do not feel like they belong in the CS community, and hearing it from authority figures is 10x worse than hearing it from a classmate. Professors have a responsibility to encourage inclusivity and respect in the classroom, so it is very disappointing to hear this disrespect from a widely praised professor here at UT. 
At the end of the presentation, when the group was taking questions, a classmate raised her hand and asked the group if they think women are only good at front end and design. The initial commenter said 'no, it's just that girls are better than me at design,' which did not address the real issue. Several people around the room spoke up in agreement that this was not an ok comment to make. I appreciate the support of my classmates and wish I could get the same support from the professor.

EDIT:  
This blog post has gone a bit further than I expected, and it has come to my attention that some other members of the class felt that Professor Downing's comment was intended to make the original commenter (who has since sincerely apologized) uncomfortable, not to agree with and further the stereotype. I do hope this was the case, and that those who I talked to about this just similarly misinterpreted the comment. I believe Professor Downing wants to make his class an inclusive place, which is why I wrote this post, which is for his class and which he was expected to read, in the first place. It was not intended to be a "Professor Downing is evil and misogynistic and no one should take his class!!!" post, because I don't believe that's true, just one pointing out the microagressions women face, even in departments like UTCS. I appreciate the feedback and support I've gotten because of this post, and hope this edit clears some things up.

**Tip of the Week**

If you have the energy, do not suffer quietly or stand by when microaggressions against anyone occur. Call out their perpetrators and speak to those in higher positions of power when applicable.
