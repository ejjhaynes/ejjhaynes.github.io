**What did you do this past week?**

Burned myself out and kept going anyway. I and the rest of my group worked very hard on Phase II and did not finish. We just could not figure out the linking on the site for connecting a specific pillar's other pillar attribute with Flask, and it was a very stressful and exhausting several days. I wish that projects were due Friday nights, especially if the next project isn't going to get released immediately anyway.

**Whatâ€™s in your way?**

I'm still so exhausted. I took Saturday off because my mental health needed a break, but one day is probably not enough to make up for everything that's piled up. I'm just trying to balance school and health- my part time work has pretty much gone out the window.

**What will you do next week?**

I have work due for two other group projects this week, as well as running a workshop for the Makers Club on Monday. I'm glad I voted last week, because there's no way I have time to stand in line on Election Day to do it. I also have a math test on Friday that I'm worried about because that class has not held a high position comparative to SWE. I need to study for that at some point.

**Class Impressions**

The further we get into these website projects the more frustrated I am. Last week, Prof Downing went over JSON and XML as if it was the first time we were seeing them, when in fact we would have needed to understand them at least a week earlier because of the API information required by the project. Having vague requirements of 'make this website, use these sometimes-overlapping tools, have fun!' leads to a lot of confusion, especially because there is no reason to assume prior knowledge of any of these tools based on the CS curricula. My group is just lucky that some of our members have learned some of these tools through outside work.

**Tip of the Week**

If I had any tips I could apply to my life, maybe I wouldn't be such a mess. Good luck. The semester is approaching the end.
