**What did you do this past week?**

Finished up most of my class work- with two exams and three presentations. 

**Whatâ€™s in your way?**

Re-learning integrals for my math exam on Saturday. 

**What will you do next week?**

I'm volunteering with UTCS Outreach for Hour of Code, and will be studying math around that.

**Final Class Impressions**

I enjoyed most of the readings, I think they were a good use of time.
I now can claim basic knowledge of Python, and I think it's a pretty cool language.
I can't really claim knowledge of any of the tools we used to build the website, because the entire thing felt rushed and slapdash due to very low experience levels in our group and not much guidance from the teaching staff, but I have some familiarity with the frameworks and concepts, at least.
The cold-calling system in class was fine, though at times it didn't feel very random.
The tests were fair and nothing like the quizzes- don't be like me, practice writing code not just recognizing what it might do.
The project group was 6-7 people- try to find ones you can work well with because you will be spending a lot of time together.
Overall, I would recommend this course, but be prepared to find your own way on the project. I don't think SWE was overwhelmingly amazing, but it was a pretty solid class and I think a lot of things I learned, even just through the readings, will help me in industry, as that is (currently) my goal. If industry isn't your goal, it may not be as applicable.
