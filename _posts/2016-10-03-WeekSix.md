**What did you do this past week?**

This past week was much less busy than the previous one, for which I am grateful. I heard back from a few companies and interview for one other, so the job search thus far looks to be going well. I'm a little more surprised with the amount of feedback that I'm getting than I should be, I think.

**Whatâ€™s in your way?**

Always time. I feel like I can prepare for this week's test just fine, I just also have a bunch of other productive human things I'm supposed to be doing with my life. 

**What will you do next week?**

I have a bulleted list of everything I need to do for all my classes plus my job plus the internship search. It should be doable, especially because I'm meeting with people for several items on the list so I'll be held accountable at those times.

**Class Impressions**

The requirements for the test don't look too bad. Coding in a text box may not be that fun, but luckily Python's syntax isn't too bad. I just have to make sure my cheat sheet is prepared.

**Tip of the Week**

I've started exploring HackerRank in anticipation of coding interviews, and it just seems like a fun site to do basic problems or learn a new language. Even if I don't end up using it for interviews, I think I'll enjoy spending time there, whether solving problems myself or helping others.
