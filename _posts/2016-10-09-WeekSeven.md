**What did you do this past week?**

Last week I prepared for this exam, but mostly focused on other classes. I made a great cheat sheet with all the notes I had taken combined with Piazza and the files we went over in class, but it didn't end up helping much. I studied entirely the wrong way, unfortunately.

**Whatâ€™s in your way?**

I have zero experience with web development. I looked over the project spec for the rest of the semester, and it looks like there will not be the level of support I've come to expect from how we learned Python, and I'm just going to have to do a lot of searching to figure out any idea of what I'm doing. At the beginning of the semester, the expectation that we hadn't worked with Python before was clear, as we started from the beginning. Here, it seems that we're going to have to just figure out all these tools without guiding instruction.

**What will you do next week?**

I have a math test on Friday that I'm not prepared for, and an essay due Wednesday I haven't started, but other than that it's business as usual. Once the project groups are finalized, we'll start meeting to develop the proposal.

**Class Impressions**

The test was fair, I just didn't prepare the right way for it. It consisted entirely of problems like the ones we do in class, where Downing says 'go implement this common method without using it!' and that's just not something I practiced. I expected more questions like those on the quizzes, where we had to figure out the exact output from some tricky syntax. I guess I know better for the last test now.

**Tip of the Week**

During interviews, talk out your thought process. Even if you have no idea how to solve the problem *well*, give it a shot. Write an n^3 solution first if you need to, just to show that you know how to solve the problem, then once you're most comfortable with the problem, it'll be easier to write a more efficient algorithm. Showing that you can move from a less complicated idea to a better one shows flexibility and quick thinking.
