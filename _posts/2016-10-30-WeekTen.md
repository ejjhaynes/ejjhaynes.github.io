**What did you do this past week?**

This past week, I worked with my group to start getting our API data ready. I explored parsing JSON files with the responses library for Python, which makes it very easy. My main focus of last week however was the alpha phase of my iOS project.

**Whatâ€™s in your way?**

I'm so stressed, y'all. I need to step back and time manage the heck out of my life, but being in group projects makes it difficult because I want to be available when other group members are, so how free I am depends on other people, which is tough. 

**What will you do next week?**

Finish part two of this project. Hopefully the people working on setting up the database finish soon so we can start filling it, testing it, and working with templates for Flask. We'll look into Angular as well, because I currently have no idea what we're going to use it for.

**Class Impressions**

I'm still a bit frustrated that we didn't learn the tools we need for this project in class. Having a 'thrown in the deep end' knowledge of CSS just doesn't feel nearly as valuable as the in depth, step by step process we went through with Python.

**Tip of the Week**

If you're sick, go home. You're not going to do quality work and you might make the lives of everyone around you worse by passing on your disease or needing others to end up redoing your work. Just go home. It's not worth it.
