**What did you do this past week?**

I worked on finishing up Phase II in regards to having the site completely linked to itself, and stressed about the election. I also took a math test.

**Whatâ€™s in your way?**

Still just trying to balance everything going on right now, and maybe not doing such a great job of it. At least this week the only thing due is Phase III, so I will be able to focus my efforts there. Time and stress management continues to be difficult for me.

**What will you do next week?**

This week we'll finish up Phase III and start preparing for our presentation. We're group 1, so we may actually put that off and possibly do it over Thanksgiving. We have the search bar implemented, and working with someone else's API may be. And adventure. 

**Class Impressions**

We've been going through very specific sets of code in class, and it's been a bit difficult for me to abstract out the point of what we're doing. I haven't been keeping up entirely with the readings, so that could be a part of it, but I'm just not finding many concrete lessons in what we do in class. 

**Tip of the Week**

Your brain needs proper nutrition to function well. If you haven't recently, eat something good for you. (I'm very bad at this, though trying to get better.)
