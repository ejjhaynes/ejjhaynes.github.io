I'm a third year student at UT, majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Human Computer Interaction. I enjoy high level languages and making a direct difference in people's lives, so automation thus far has been a favorite experience in the workplace.

This year I'm running the UTCS Maker's Club, an organization under the Women in CS umbrella that focuses on making fun projects for students throughout the year. We are planning to meet roughly once a month on Friday afternoons, so keep an eye on the screens in the GDC for more info!
